This document helps you set up a simplified lab to review hardware-accelerated GPU virtualization for  Windows desktop VDI workloads on Citrix XenServer. True GPU virtualization (a.k.a vGPU) on NVIDIA GRID  cards is supported since Service Pack 1 of Citrix XenServer 6.2. It extends high-performance GPU sharing capabilities beyond Windows Server RDS workloads, that we cover in part 1 and part 2 of this series of Guides; Part 3 walks through the following topics:

  * How to obtain the necessary components for the feature review

	
  * Install NVIDIA GRID GPU, and configure vGPU in XenServer

	
  * Assign vGPU to XenDesktop 7.1 Windows Desktop VM’s

	
  * Install and publish GPU-accelerated Virtual Desktops (VDI) using Studio

	
  *  Access GPU-accelerated Virtual Desktops (VDI) from Citrix Receiver on any device

	
  *  Verify 3D applications on multiple desktops are sharing the same physical GPU
