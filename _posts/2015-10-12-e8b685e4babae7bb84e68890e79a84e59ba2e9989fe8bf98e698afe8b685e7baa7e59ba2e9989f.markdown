### About the book















![TED Book: Beyond Measure](https://tedcdnpi-a.akamaihd.net/r/pb-assets.tedcdn.com/system/baubles/files/000/002/439/original/TEDBook_heffernan_cover.jpg?w=320)














In this wise and witty guide to creating strong company culture, business leader Margaret Heffernan lays the groundwork for a new kind of thinking: Organizations can create seismic shifts by making deceptively small changes.

Far beyond a prescriptive list, this book spills over with fascinating anecdotes from organizations around the world. Heffernan reveals the surprisingly small changes any organization can make: how to empower every person as a leader: how to open channels as a real, active listening; the important of cutting back hours (and also leaning into crunch time); why leaving the office does wonders for your working brain; how conflict works as an essential tool for creative thinking; why companies that actively solicit involvement beyond their walls are so much more effective; how simple activities strengthen social capital between workers.

Packed with compelling stories and startling statistics, Heffernan takes readers on a tour across the globe. Drawing from her years of experience as a business leader and ultimately proving that it's often the small changes that make the greatest, most lasting impact.





















<blockquote>

> 
> This book is aimed at everyone — from the CEO to the janitor — who wants a better place to work. It looks at the accumulation of small, everyday thoughts and habits that generate and sustain culture: ways of speaking, listening, arguing, thinking, seeing. These aren’t multimillion dollar, multi-year programs; these are small steps that anyone can take at any time, the small steps that mark the beginning of big change.
