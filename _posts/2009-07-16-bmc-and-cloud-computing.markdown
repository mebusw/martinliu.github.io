July 15, 2009 â€“ BMC Software has announced that it is leveraging Amazon Web Services to provide a single, unified management solution meant to give customers control over existing internal IT assets and external cloud infrastructures, according to a company release.<br /><br />[http://www.information-management.com/news/amazon_bmc_software_cloud_computing-10015748-1.html](http://www.information-management.com/news/amazon_bmc_software_cloud_computing-10015748-1.html)<br /><br />BTW: it seems the IT management is as important as infrastructure.
