excerpt: 'Everyone''s talking about the "Internet of Things," but what exactly does
  that mean for our future? In this thoughtful talk, economist Marco Annunziata looks
  at how technology is transforming the industrial sector, creating machines that
  can see, feel, sense and react â€” so they can be operated far more efficiently. Think:
  airplane parts that send an alert when they need to be serviced, or wind turbines
  that communicate with one another to generate more electricity. It''s a future with
  exciting implications for us all. '
