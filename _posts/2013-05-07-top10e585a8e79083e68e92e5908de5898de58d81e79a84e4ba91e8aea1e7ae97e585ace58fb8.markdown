Citrix榜上有名排名第三，这就是我看好CloudStack一年多的回报，国内CloudStack目前看还没有什么生机，希望能早点发展起来。

We all know change is constant, especially in technology. Look at Toshiba, a world leader and innovator in high technology. This week, the company made an interesting move and announced the opening of Toshiba’s first datacenter in Europe, located in France.

Toshiba Cloud & Solutions Division is directed at professional markets, public and private-sector companies, and entities within the Toshiba Group. The creation of this datacenter is in line with the Group’s goal of accompanying its clients right from the design of IT products and solutions through to hosting related services tailored to specific needs.

The datacenter also hosts firms located in other regions, illustrating Toshiba’s broader ambitions. [![](http://www.intelligenthq.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Cloud-Computing-180x110.jpg)](http://www.intelligenthq.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Cloud-Computing.jpeg)

“_Developing this first datacenter in Rhône-Alpes highlights the importance of the Grand Lyon project for Toshiba and embodies the group’s investment in the development of its Cloud offering_,_”_  explains Philippe Hartmanshenn, Managing Director of Toshiba Systèmes France’s Cloud & Solutions Division.

“_This allows us to move both internal and external client resources and services offsite to our high-security servers – located in France. We also plan to use the datacenter to develop and integrate business solutions for our clients from every sector.”_

__I felt the need to highlight this as it shows the importance of the cloud, as an important tool to innovation regardless of industry.
