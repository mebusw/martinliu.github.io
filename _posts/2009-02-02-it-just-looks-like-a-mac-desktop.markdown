So, you might need a new Mac skin for your desktop, no matter MS Windows or Linux OS. I'd like share two tips, you can make a Mac desktop in  minutes.<br /><br />**For Windows: **FlyakiteOSX is a all-in-one package. It much more easier then making a Mac-buntu. Does it slow down you windows system? Of course, yes. it's just a little bit and acceptable for me.<br /><br />![](http://osx.portraitofakite.com/header.png)<br /><br />**For Gnome Linux:**<br /><br />There is a open source prject on the SourceForge.net: [http://sourceforge.net/projects/mac4lin](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mac4lin) You need download the package and un-tar it. A pdf document will walk you through every settings. I made my Mac-buntu just in 20 minutes. I do not like 'global meun' and widget, so I ingored them.  <!-- more --><br /><br />My laptop is a dual boot Dell D630; with MS Windows Xp for work and Ubuntu for fun. Now, them all looks like Mac OS X Leopard. Check it out.<br /><br />[http://picasaweb.google.com/liuzh66/ItJustLooksLikeMac](http://picasaweb.google.com/liuzh66/ItJustLooksLikeMac)
