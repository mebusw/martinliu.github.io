After 2 crazy months, I finished the longest PoC. This is for CCB CMDB testing. We are fightting with CA,HP,IBM and Utrual Power. It has 3 rounds, took me almost 3 month to finish.<br /><br />![halo-wordpress](http://cdn1.martinliu.cn/wp-content/uploads/266/26670/2009/07/halo-wordpress.jpg)<br /><br />Today, I finally got have a chance to do something for my blog. I finally move to a new hosting and attached martinliu.cn domain name on it. Wordpress was updated to 2.8.1 with new theme.  I love this theme for three reasons: 1)自动全屏显示； 2)大气；3)自带弹性的调整options。Now the only concern is MySQL space is only 50 MB. As far as I can tell it could be enough for my 2years blog. So, keep posting and happy blog.
