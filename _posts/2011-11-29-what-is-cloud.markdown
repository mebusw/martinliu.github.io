<blockquote>什么是云计算？这还用问么？当然.....</blockquote>


[box]Cloud computing is an entirely new paradigm shift in how IT services are built, managed and consumed. Cloud computing delivers higher efficiency, limitless scale and faster and easier deployment of new services and systems to the end users. Cloud computing also changes the economics of the datacenter by shifting the delivery of IT resources to an on-demand model. In the process, cloud computing is opening up new business models and opportunities for enterprise and service providers.  From: [cloud.com](http://docs.cloud.com/FAQ%3A_Cloud.com/What_is_Cloud_Computing%3F)[/box]
